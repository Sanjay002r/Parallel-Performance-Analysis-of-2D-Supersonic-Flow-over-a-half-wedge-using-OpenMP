High Performance Scientific Computing | Prof. Shivasubramanian Gopalakrishnan, IIT Bombay
• Simulated flow over a 2-D half-wedge of angle 15◦ at Mach 2.5 using Roe’s Flux Difference Scheme in C++
• Solved Euler equation with Van-Albada flux limiter achieving 2nd-order accuracy in shock resolution
• Achieved 3 times speedup with 4 processors, and max. efficiency with 2 processors, analyzing overhead time
